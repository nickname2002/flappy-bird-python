# Flappy Bird | JorCademy Engine

## Description
The legendary mobile game, Flappy Bird, created using the JorCademy Engine. The purpose of this project was to test the capabilities of the template to create functional games. 

## Controls
Press `space` to start the game and control the bird. 
When Game Over, press `up_arrow` to return to the starting menu. 

## Running the project
In order to run the program, installation of the Pygame library is required. Pygame can be installed using Python's package manager: pip. Use the following terminal command:
```
pip install pygame
```
If this command does not work, try `pip3` instead of `pip`.

To run the project, first change the directory to the subfolder using the following terminal command:
```
cd jorcademy_python_template.main
```
To run the game, enter the following command in the terminal on macOS/Linux:
```
python3 main.py
```
When on Windows, try the command above without `python3`.

## Maintainability
As the development of this game was just to test the capabilities of the JorCademy Engine, the application will not be developed any further.
