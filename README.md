# Flappy Bird | JorCademy Engine

## Description
The legendary mobile game, Flappy Bird, created using the JorCademy Engine. The purpose of this project was to test the capabilities of the template to create functional games. 

## Controls
The only button needed to play the game is `space`.

## Running the project
In order to run the program, installation of the Pygame library is required. Pygame can be installed using Python's package manager: pip. Use the following terminal command:
```
pip install pygame
```
## Maintainability
As the development of this game was just to test the capabilities of the JorCademy Engine, the application will not be developed any further.
